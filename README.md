# NYC Citi Bike Share



## Overview
Analyze the NYC Citi Bike share program to see if it is a fit for Des Moines. We looked at one month of data in the summer of August 2019 to see how bikes are being used and who is using them. Specifically, we looked at:


- Length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.


## Results

- Trips are mostly during commuting hours, with Thursdays having the most riders
- Most riders are male

## Summary
The bike program appears to be a success in NYC. Before expanding to Des Moines, we strongly encourage the comparison between NYC's demographics and Des Moines to make sure the customers exist.
We also suggest creating a few more visualizations:
  - Map the start and end points as lines radiating out of the checkout station
  - Scatter plot of users with weekend rides on one axis and weekday rides on the other.
